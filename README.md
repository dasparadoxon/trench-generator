This is a simple project in Processing 3.x to generate a trench like in World War 1.

Right now you can change the number of bents in the trench line. <br/>
<BR>
Added some ladders with a transparent texture.<br/>
Sandbags are now added. When theres a ladder, the sandbag is not placed</br>
The dimension of the battlefield can now be changed, making really long trenches possible<br/>


It is using <a href="http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/">controlP5</a> for UI Elements and <a href="http://mrfeinberg.com/peasycam/">peasycam</a> as camera script.<br/>

It's aim is to generate all the vertices and objects in a clear format so that other scripts can use them to quickly generate the trench in their domain.
